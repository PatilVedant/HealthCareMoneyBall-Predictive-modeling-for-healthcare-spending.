# HealthCareMoneyBall-Predictive-modeling-for-healthcare-spending.
Based on the data, the case's main objective is to offer invaluable insights and precisely
estimate which individuals (clients) would be pricey. We intended to analyze and draw
necessary factors that lead to actionable insights and provide recommendations in order to
help an individual cut their costs.

The data employed in this project is real life data from a Healthcare management organization.
This data consists of various factors that influence the patientâ€™s healthcare cost every year
such as age, smoking habits, location where the person is staying at, type of environment in
which the individual lives in, hypertension, body mass index, exercise habits, etc. We'll focus
on identifying the elements that might lead to a patient having a big hospital bill for next year
and using statistical methods to gain useful information.
The workings of the project consist of using various data analysis techniques and models to
support the interpreted recommendations, driven by correlational trends between the various
parameters present in the healthcare dataset
